You've been developing the payroll application for the past two weeks. So far, you've been working locally and have had success. Now you want to migrate the application to the GCP using Compute Engine as a VM and Cloud SQL as a database. You created a service account with the appropriate access rights. You want to make sure that the VM uses this service account instead of the default Compute Engine service account. What should you do?
